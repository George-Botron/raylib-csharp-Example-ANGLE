# raylib-cs with raylib ANGLE / Direct3D11 on Windows

This repo builds a native `raylib.dll` for Windows x64 that uses this path:

```text
raylib-cs -> raylib.dll built for OpenGL ES 2.0 -> ANGLE libEGL/libGLESv2 -> Direct3D11
```

The C# code stays normal raylib-cs code. Direct3D is selected by the native `raylib.dll` you ship beside the C# app.

The included sample uses `Raylib-cs` `8.0.0`, which targets `net8.0` / `net10.0` and matches the workflow's default native raylib `6.0` build.

## Why this is needed

The normal raylib-cs native binary uses desktop OpenGL on Windows. That means old, broken, missing, or RDP-affected OpenGL drivers can cause app startup failures.

ANGLE is a compatibility layer that exposes OpenGL ES/EGL to the app and translates it to backends such as Direct3D 11 on Windows. This repo builds raylib as an OpenGL ES 2.0 desktop library and links it to ANGLE.

## Files produced

## Build it in GitHub Actions

Go to:

```text
Actions -> Build raylib ANGLE Direct3D11 for raylib-cs -> Run workflow
```

The workflow builds native raylib:

```text
6.0
```

`6.0` is the only workflow option because it matches the included `Raylib-cs` `8.0.0` sample.

The workflow does this:

1. Installs ANGLE using `vcpkg install angle:x64-windows`.
2. Clones raylib.
3. Patches raylib's Windows Desktop CMake link step with a whitespace-tolerant regex so `OPENGL_VERSION="ES 2.0"` links to `libEGL.lib` and `libGLESv2.lib`, not `opengl32.lib`.
4. Patches the raylib GLFW platform source that actually contains `glfwInit()` (`src/platforms/rcore_desktop_glfw.c` in raylib 6.0) to request `GLFW_ANGLE_PLATFORM_TYPE_D3D11` before `glfwInit()`.
5. Builds `raylib.dll` as a shared library.
6. Verifies `raylib.dll` directly depends on `libGLESv2.dll`, does not depend on `OPENGL32.dll`, and packages `libEGL.dll` beside it.
7. Builds the included `Raylib-cs` `8.0.0` sample.
8. Uploads a zip artifact.

## Use the built Direct3D raylib in another C# project

In your external project, keep using the normal `Raylib-cs` NuGet package. For the current raylib 6.0 native build, use `Raylib-cs` `8.0.0`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Raylib-cs" Version="8.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Then copy the **entire** `native/` folder from the artifact into your project. Do not copy only `raylib.dll`, `libEGL.dll`, and `libGLESv2.dll`; the ANGLE build may also need transitive DLLs such as `zlib1.dll` and VC++ runtime DLLs.

Example project layout:

```text
native/win-x64/raylib.dll
native/win-x64/libEGL.dll
native/win-x64/libGLESv2.dll
native/win-x64/d3dcompiler_47.dll
native/win-x64/zlib1.dll                 if present in the artifact
native/win-x64/vcruntime140.dll          if present in the artifact
native/win-x64/msvcp140.dll              if present in the artifact
```

Add this to your `.csproj` so every packaged native DLL is copied:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Include="native\win-x64\*.dll" CopyToOutputDirectory="PreserveNewest" />
  <None Include="native\win-x64\build-info.txt" CopyToOutputDirectory="PreserveNewest" Condition="Exists('native\win-x64\build-info.txt')" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Build for Windows x64:

```powershell
dotnet build -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false
```

Your output folder must contain `Raylib_cs.dll`, `raylib.dll`, `libEGL.dll`, `libGLESv2.dll`, and every additional DLL present in the artifact's `native/` folder. If `zlib1.dll` is in the artifact, it must also be beside your `.exe`.

## Minimal C# example

```csharp
using Raylib_cs;
using static Raylib_cs.Raylib;

InitWindow(800, 450, "raylib-cs through ANGLE / D3D11");
SetTargetFPS(60);

while (!WindowShouldClose())
{
    BeginDrawing();
    ClearBackground(Color.RayWhite);
    DrawText("raylib-cs + ANGLE / Direct3D11", 40, 40, 24, Color.DarkBlue);
    DrawText($"FPS: {GetFPS()}", 40, 80, 20, Color.DarkGreen);
    EndDrawing();
}

CloseWindow();
```

There is no `UseDirectX()` call in raylib-cs. The Direct3D path is provided by the native DLLs.

## Verify you are really using ANGLE / Direct3D

### Verify the DLL link dependencies

From a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell:

```powershell
dumpbin /dependents .\raylib.dll
```

Expected direct dependency:

```text
libGLESv2.dll
```

Expected packaged runtime files beside `raylib.dll`:

```text
libEGL.dll
libGLESv2.dll
```

Unexpected for this build:

```text
OPENGL32.dll
```

`libEGL.dll` may not appear as a direct dependency of `raylib.dll` in `dumpbin /dependents`. That is acceptable for this build. The important checks are that `raylib.dll` imports `libGLESv2.dll`, does not import `OPENGL32.dll`, and `libEGL.dll` is packaged beside the executable.

### Verify while running

Run your C# app and inspect loaded modules using Visual Studio, Process Explorer, or Process Monitor. You should see:

```text
libEGL.dll
libGLESv2.dll
d3d11.dll
dxgi.dll
```

## RDP behavior

This build usually starts more reliably over RDP than desktop OpenGL because it uses Direct3D through ANGLE. It may still use WARP/software rendering unless the host is configured to expose the hardware GPU to Remote Desktop sessions.

## Notes and limitations

- This is Windows x64 only.
- This uses raylib's GLFW desktop platform with OpenGL ES 2.0 context creation.
- This repo patches raylib to request ANGLE's D3D11 backend through GLFW using `GLFW_ANGLE_PLATFORM_TYPE_D3D11`.
- Confirm the runtime path with Process Explorer, Visual Studio Modules, or Process Monitor. You should see `libEGL.dll`, `libGLESv2.dll`, `d3d11.dll`, and `dxgi.dll` loaded.
- Keep the native files beside the `.exe`; do not put them only in the source folder.
- The raylib-cs NuGet may copy its own `raylib.dll`. Your custom `raylib.dll` must be the one in the final output directory.

## Troubleshooting

### App starts but still loads `opengl32.dll`

Your custom native `raylib.dll` was overwritten or not copied. Check the final output folder and run:

```powershell
dumpbin /dependents .\bin\Release\net10.0-windows\win-x64\raylib.dll
```

### Missing `libEGL.dll` or `libGLESv2.dll`

Copy them beside your `.exe`. They must be in the same folder as `raylib.dll`, or otherwise resolvable by the Windows DLL loader.

### `DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'raylib' or one of its dependencies`

This usually means `raylib.dll` is present but a transitive dependency is missing. Copy the whole artifact `native/` folder beside your executable, especially DLLs such as `zlib1.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll`, and `msvcp140.dll` if they are present. The included CI smoke test runs `RaylibAngleSample.exe --load-test` to catch this before upload.

### Missing `d3dcompiler_47.dll`

Modern Windows usually has it in `System32`, but self-contained app folders can include it. If the workflow copied it into the artifact, ship it beside the app.

### Black window or crash at `InitWindow`

First verify dependencies with `dumpbin`. Then use Process Monitor to check whether Windows failed to load a DLL. Common causes are architecture mismatch, overwritten `raylib.dll`, missing ANGLE DLLs, or using a raylib version whose CMake layout changed and the patch did not apply correctly.


## Maintainer notes: previous patch failures

The build has two intentional patches and both are targeted at the raylib 6.0 layout:

1. `cmake/LibraryConfigurations.cmake` is patched so Windows Desktop + `OPENGL_VERSION="ES 2.0"` links against ANGLE's `libGLESv2.lib` / `libEGL.lib`, not `opengl32.lib`.
2. `src/platforms/rcore_desktop_glfw.c` is patched before the real `glfwInit()` call so GLFW requests `GLFW_ANGLE_PLATFORM_TYPE_D3D11`. Earlier attempts incorrectly searched `src/rcore.c` or only matched a standalone `glfwInit();` line; raylib 6.0 uses the platform-split backend and can write the call as `if (!glfwInit())`.

The verification step checks the output, not just the patch text: `raylib.dll` must import `libGLESv2.dll`, must not import `OPENGL32.dll`, and the packaged runtime must contain `libEGL.dll` / `libGLESv2.dll`.


## Notes about the Python build scripts

The build logic is in Python now, not PowerShell:

```text
scripts/build_raylib_angle.py
scripts/verify_angle_raylib.py
```

The root fix is that the D3D11 hint patch no longer assumes raylib's GLFW code lives in `src/rcore.c`. raylib 6.0 uses the platform-split backend under `src/platforms/rcore_desktop_glfw.c`; the Python script searches raylib platform sources for the actual `glfwInit(...)` call and inserts `glfwInitHint(GLFW_ANGLE_PLATFORM_TYPE, GLFW_ANGLE_PLATFORM_TYPE_D3D11);` immediately before it.

Correct native verification:

```text
raylib.dll must import libGLESv2.dll
raylib.dll must not import OPENGL32.dll
libEGL.dll must be packaged beside raylib.dll
libEGL.dll does not have to appear as a direct dumpbin dependency of raylib.dll
```


## Native dependency packaging note

The sample must contain more than only:

```text
raylib.dll
libEGL.dll
libGLESv2.dll
```

With vcpkg's dynamic Windows triplet (`x64-windows`), transitive DLLs from
`C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin` may also be required, for example
`zlib1.dll`. The build script copies every DLL from that vcpkg runtime folder
into `artifacts/raylib-angle-win-x64`.

The script also packages available VC++ runtime DLLs such as:

```text
vcruntime140.dll
vcruntime140_1.dll
msvcp140.dll
```

This prevents `System.DllNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'raylib' or one
of its dependencies (0x8007007E)` on machines that do not have the Visual C++
Redistributable installed.

CI also runs:

```powershell
.\artifacts\RaylibAngleSample\RaylibAngleSample.exe --load-test
```

That calls the first raylib P/Invoke without opening a window, so missing native
dependencies fail during CI instead of only on the user's machine.
